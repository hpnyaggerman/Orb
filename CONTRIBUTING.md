# Contributing to Orb

Thanks for wanting to contribute. Here's what to do before opening a PR.

## 1. Get things running locally

Make sure the feature or fix works first.

Start the backend with `./run_unix.sh` (or `run_windows.bat` on Windows). Python 3.9+ required.

### Optional: Auto-formatting on commit

Run `pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt` to set up Python formatters.

Run `npm install` to set up git hooks via Lefthook. This auto-formats staged files before each commit:

- **Python** — Black (formatting) + Flake8 (linting)
- **JavaScript** — Biome (formatting)

No more CI failures from formatting issues. Requires Node.js.

## 2. Run the checks

Everything lives in `scripts/`. Run them before you push:

- **Tests** - `./scripts/tests.sh all`
- **Format** - `./scripts/format_backend.sh` and `./scripts/format_frontend.sh`
- **Lint** - `./scripts/lint.sh`
- **Compatibility** - `./scripts/compatibility_test.sh`

If any of these fail, fix it before submitting.

## 3. Open a PR

- Keep it focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Write a summary in the PR description that explains the what and the why.
- Link any related issues.

## 4. AI-assisted contributions

AI-generated code is welcome, but it needs extra scrutiny. If you're using an AI coding tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.), read `AGENTS.md` at the repo root first. It contains the architecture, database schema, API reference, and gotchas specific to this project — the stuff these tools need to produce correct code.

## 5. Quick rules

- Small models first. If a feature doesn't work on something like Gemma 4 26B4A, it probably doesn't belong here.
- Only use agentic functionalities when absolutely needed - we will not have useless tools like `dice_roll`
- Keep the agent's scope tight - less freedom, fewer hallucinations.
- If something can be done with an algorithm, don't use an LLM for it.
- AI-generated code is accepted. It will be manually reviewed just like human written code. But must be subjected to more testing.
- What about support for other languages? => The repo is optimized for English only, especially the tts and detection algorithms. You'd probably wanna fork if your use case is non-English. Can't support grammar for every language under the sun.

## 6. Vision

- This is a writing/RP frontend and it will not pretend to be anything else. For general assistant tasks, use proper frontends like llama-ui or Open-WebUI.
- There will not be support for code execution, file browsing, web uploads, etc. basically anything that opens up an RCE attack surface that may compromise the user's machine and personal data.
- Orb's workflow is a chat frontend, we will not bloat it into a pseudo game engine with arbitrarily complex features that require learning (e.g. locations, maps, global stat tracking etc.).
