# registered statically and enabled per-turn by a feature gate, never by the

# activation -- every other lorebook field keeps a safe default the user can
# edit afterwards through the normal reviewed path, which keeps this schema (and
# therefore the shared per-turn tool blob) small and stable.
#
# Every field is one more thing a model can get wrong, so this asks only for
# what the model alone knows: `op` offers three verbs rather than the five the
# table stores (`validate_proposal` derives the stored one from the target row),
# and `rationale` comes first so a model emitting properties in schema order
# writes the justification before the change it justifies rather than after.
#
# Property order is load-bearing the other way round at the top level:
# `operations` precedes `summary`. The call is forced, so a model that writes a
# summary first has already declared a proposal exists, and an empty operations
# list then contradicts the sentence it just wrote -- it fills one in. Enumerate
# first, describe second, and proposing nothing stays available all the way
# through the call.
