"""Pure search/replace patch application.

Deliberately a separate copy of the editor's ``apply_patches`` rather than a
shared import: the editor's lives in ``backend/pipeline/``, a higher layer this
workflow may not import. It also omits the editor's quote/asterisk
normalization fallbacks on purpose -- this workflow exists to fix quote/asterisk
markup, so normalizing during the match would hide the very drift it must catch.
Keep both facts in mind before "DRY-ing" this away.
