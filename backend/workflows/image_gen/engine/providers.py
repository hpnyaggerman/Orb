"""Cloud image provider presets and the pure request builders that read them.

No I/O -- every function below maps arguments to a value, so each provider's wire
format is unit-testable without a network.

**The request builder is a strict allowlist.** xAI silently ignores unknown fields,
so the API never tells you a parameter was wrong: send `negative_prompt` to a
provider that has no such field and it returns a perfectly good image that ignored
it. A field is emitted only when the preset declares it.

Only the **xai**, **togetherai**, **openrouter**, **openai** and **nanogpt** rows are
verified against the live API; every other row is declared from vendor documentation
and marked ``verified=False`` -- and every verified row contradicted its own catalogue
or docs on a field that fails silently, which is what the flag is warning about.
Each row carries the measurement that corrected it.

**A provider with no JSON reference field is not a row here.** Chutes, Z.AI and
ElectronHub were, and were dropped on that test; the comment above `aimlapi` says why.

OpenAI is the row that shows an unverified one is not merely imprecise but can be
*inert*: declared from its documentation it sent `response_format`, which that API
rejects outright, so every render 400'd before it began.

A provider's own catalogue is not evidence either. OpenRouter's image models
advertise `seed` and an `image` input modality; both are the `/chat/completions`
schema, and both are inert on the images path. Only a measured effect counts.
