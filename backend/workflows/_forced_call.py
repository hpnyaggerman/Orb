"""One-shot forced tool call helper for workflow authors.

Wraps a single ``client.complete(tool_choice=...)`` invocation: assembles
the tools array, optionally records the call against a KV-cache tracker,
forwards reasoning deltas to the SSE stream when the caller supplied a
``pass_id``, and yields exactly one terminal ``{"type": "result", "args":
<dict>}`` event. Never raises -- tool-call missing, parse failure, or any
network error all degrade to ``{"type": "result", "args": {}}`` so a
single bad LLM reply cannot crash a workflow.

    Reasoning deltas yield as ``{"event": "reasoning", "data": {"pass":
    pass_id, "delta": ...}}`` when ``pass_id`` is set (the orchestrator
    forwards these to SSE); they are suppressed when ``pass_id`` is None
    so on-demand handlers without an SSE stream do not need to filter.
    The terminal event is always ``{"type": "result", "args": <dict>}``.

    Tools assembly:
      - ``offer_tools=<names>`` -- fixed, order-stable array of those
        registry tools (forced ``tool_name`` appended if absent). Use to
        share one blob across sibling forced calls so a provider that must
        keep tools in the body still lets them reuse each other's cached
        prefix. Takes precedence over ``enabled_tools``. Collapses to the
        single forced tool on providers that don't honor forcing (known up
        front via ``honors_forced_tool_choice``, or learned from a reply that
        called some other tool) -- an unforced array picks its own tool.
      - ``enabled_tools=None`` -- single-tool array. Smallest bytes; use
        when the caller does not need pipeline tools-bytes cache reuse.
      - ``enabled_tools=<dict>`` -- assemble the same tools array
        ``enabled_schemas(enabled_tools, schema_overrides)`` returns. If
        ``tool_name`` is standalone or otherwise absent from the result,
        append its schema so the forced ``tool_choice`` resolves.
        ``schema_overrides`` must be the dict the pipeline shipped this
        turn (``pre_ctx.schema_overrides`` / ``post_ctx.schema_overrides``)
        for byte-identical tools cache reuse.

    ``kv_tracker=None`` skips the per-call ``record(...)`` + ``record_usage(...)``
    steps silently (the on-demand path does not participate in turn caching).

    ``model_name`` overrides ``settings["model_name"]`` for callers on another
    resolved lane. The same value labels the KV tracker and the wire request.

    ``tools_in_prompt=False`` forwards the client flag of the same name: the
    prompt must not carry the tool schemas (text mode never renders them; chat
    mode then forces via ``response_format`` and omits ``tools`` from the body).
    Use it for off-turn calls that ride a cached conversation prefix, so the
    forced tool's schema cannot perturb the server-rendered prompt bytes.
