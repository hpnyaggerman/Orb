"""Pure predicates for whether a workflow is currently enabled.

The ``settings`` row is the single source of truth: ``workflows_globally_enabled``
(a master switch) and ``workflow_enabled`` (a per-workflow ``{id: bool}`` map).
A missing global or local value defaults to enabled, so a fresh install and any
future workflow start on. The registry's ``Workflow`` record carries no enabled
flag -- it is rebuilt at import and would lose the state on restart.

These take an already-loaded settings snapshot rather than reading the DB: every
gate site already holds one, so the predicate stays pure and table-testable with
no in-memory cache mirror to invalidate. The settings-column names live here, not
in ``registry.py``, so the pure registry resolvers stay decoupled from the
settings-row shape.
