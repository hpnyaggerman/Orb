"""
Contrastive-negation ("AI slop") detector.

Catches rhetorical patterns like:
    "It's not a bug, but a feature."
    "This isn't a setback, it is an opportunity."
    "He doesn't just give up; he breaks down."

Avoids common false positives:
    - "not only … but (also)"
    - infinitive negation ("told him not to go, but …")
    - regular clause contrast ("I'm not sure, but I think …")
    - unrelated be-verb reappearance ("isn't done, but the deadline is …")
    - questions ("Isn't that odd? Where is …")
    - different-subject switches ("He isn't X, she is Y")
