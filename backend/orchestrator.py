    is the final pipeline prefix including any extra system blocks --
    construction lives in the caller so the pre-pipeline iteration site can

    (today: ``{"direct_scene": build_direct_scene_tool(director_fragments)}``)
    and threads here so every pass receives it for byte-identical tools.
    *history* is the prior-message list forwarded read-only onto each
