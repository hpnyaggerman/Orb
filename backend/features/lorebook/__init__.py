"""Lorebook feature slice — pure world-info activation, selection, and rendering.

A ``features/`` slice: pure domain logic that depends only **downward** on
``core`` (for ``Macros``) — no ``inference``, ``database``, or peer slice. Its
selection/rendering is consumed by the director stage
(``pipeline.passes.director``, via the ``LorebookTurn`` bundle) and the
context-size route (``api.routes.conversations``) — both layers *above* the
slice, so the one-way rule holds.

The per-turn threading bundle ``LorebookTurn`` is **not** here — it is a pipeline
concern and lives with the other per-turn contracts in ``pipeline/state.py``.

The facade re-exports the activation functions and the scan-depth constants.
