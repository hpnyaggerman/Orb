"""Shared kernel — dependency-free leaves imported by every layer above.

This package is the bottom of the one-way dependency order
(``api → {pipeline, features} → workflows → {inference, analysis} → core``).
It imports nothing upward; everything else may import it.

The facade re-exports the kernel surface so callers write ``from .core import X``
regardless of which submodule ``X`` actually lives in. Patch the *canonical*
submodule (e.g. ``backend.core.locks._workflow_state_locks``), never this facade.
