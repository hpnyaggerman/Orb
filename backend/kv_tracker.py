"""
kv_tracker.py — Lightweight KV-cache hit/miss estimator shared across passes.

Serializes the full prompt (messages + tools) for each LLM call, then computes
the actual character-level common prefix between consecutive calls to estimate
cache reuse.  Character counts are a proxy for token counts — no tokeniser needed.

Cross-turn tracking: when a pass has no same-model predecessor in the current
turn (would show "baseline"), it falls back to the matching label from the
previous turn so inter-turn cache reuse is visible.
