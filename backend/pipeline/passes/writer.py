# solo turn, reads it from the system body *before* the transcript. That
# inversion falls out of the cache layout rather than intent: Private keeps the
# shared body speaker-independent, so the speaking card has nowhere to go but
# the tail. The cost is that a fixed, present-tense sheet becomes the last
# identity text the model reads before writing, outranking a transcript that has
# since changed the character's hair, dress or gear. One line restores the
# reading order the placement destroys. It is billed on every writer and editor
# call, so it stays one sentence.
#
# It deliberately does not date the sheet. `group_sheet_updates` can bring it
# current mid-scene, and "from the scene's start" would then be a false claim
# about the very text the user had just approved — telling the model to discount
# the update rather than the drift. The transcript still wins either way, which
# is the only thing this line has to establish.
