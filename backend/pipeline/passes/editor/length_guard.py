passes/editor/length_guard.py — The length-guard feature.

Caps response length in two arms:

* *Preventive* (writer): :func:`writer_nudge` appends a "keep it under N words"
  instruction to the writer's user message, only in enforce mode.
* *Corrective* (editor): :func:`evaluate_length_guard` checks the finished draft
  and, when it overshoots, gives the editor a directive to call ``editor_rewrite``.

:func:`resolve_length_guard` converts raw settings into the :class:`LengthGuard`
config; a non-None result means the guard is enabled. :func:`apply_length_guard_tools`
ensures ``editor_rewrite`` is present in every pass's tool blob.
