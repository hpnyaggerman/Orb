    "- Copy each `search` value exactly from the current draft, including case, whitespace, and punctuation.\n"

    "- Return all useful edits in one `patches` array; do not rewrite the entire draft.\n"

    "- Each issue in the report below is numbered. The `id` field must be the number of the issue you are fixing.\n"
    "- Emit one patch per issue — do not skip any, and do not patch the same id twice.\n"
    "- `replace` is the new text for that sentence. Do not copy the old sentence into it.\n"
    "- The replacement text must be complete and make sense in the context.\n"
    "- For banned phrases: completely rewrite the sentence to eliminate the banned phrase. Make a creative and bold effort; do not just substitute with similar words.\n"
    "- For repetitive openers: rewrite flagged sentences so they no longer begin with the same opening words. Vary the sentence structure.\n"
    "- For repetitive templates: restructure flagged sentences so they no longer follow the same POS pattern. Change clause order, combine sentences, vary syntax.\n"
    "- For repetitive phrases: rewrite flagged phrases, changing the subject.\n"
    "- For contrastive negation ('not X, but Y'): rewrite sentences that use this cliché construction. Consider alternative phrasing that avoids this rhetorical formula.\n"
    "- For interrogative dialogue: replace the dialogue with something entirely different."
)

EDITOR_REWRITE_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "Use `editor_rewrite` to produce a rewrite within the specified limits.\n\n"
    "REWRITING RULES:\n"
    "- Preserve the author's vocabulary and creative word choices and all key story beats. Sentence starters should be varied.\n"
    "- First priority is to get rid of repetitiveness and condense comma-separated adjectives into stronger, more precise words (e.g. old, ruined building -> decrepit building).\n"
