"""
passes/editor/feedback.py — Feedback step of the editor pass.

Runs at the end of the editor pass and produces an out-of-character note for the
user (not the writer). Calls ``give_feedback`` with the enabled
``field_type='feedback'`` interactive fragments as parameters.

This inverts the Interactive Fragment direction: ``direct_scene`` steers the
writer (AI→AI), while ``give_feedback`` surfaces a note to the player (AI→user).

The ``give_feedback`` schema rides the shared per-turn tool blob, so this step
reuses the unchanged base and only forces ``tool_choice=give_feedback``. It also
replays the writer's exact user message and reply (mirroring the editor) so the
call extends the warm writer/editor KV-cached prefix rather than forking off the
bare ``base.prefix`` — the latter would collapse the cache hit to just the
system+tools block.
