"""
passes/director/progressive.py — Director-local owner of progressive-fragment logic.

Progressive fragments (``field_type == "progressive"``) are director-controlled
fields whose value evolves turn-over-turn. Their state is the sibling of
``active_moods``: a *seed* from the prior turn, an *output* this turn, and a
branch-aware reset. Both helpers here are pure.

- :func:`select` is used symmetrically — to seed (filter ``director["progressive_fields"]``)
  and to derive output (filter ``extra_fields``): keep only keys whose fragment
  is progressive.
- :func:`branch_baseline` resolves the reset value used when regenerating or
  forking: the grandparent assistant message's progressive fields.
