"""
passes/director/lorebook_select.py -- Agentic-lorebook selection step.

Asks the model, via a forced ``select_lorebook`` call, which lorebook entries from the
catalog belong in the current scene. This is the standalone replacement for the old
``selected_lorebook_entries`` parameter that used to ride the ``direct_scene`` tool, so
agentic lorebook works whether or not the Director's scene-direction tool is enabled
(gated only by ``agentic_lorebook_enabled`` + the global agent + a non-constant entry).

The wire schema is the fixed ``select_lorebook`` tool held in the shared per-turn blob, so
the call reuses the cached base and only forces the tool choice; the selectable catalog
rides this step's OOC trailing. Errors and aborts are swallowed into an empty selection --
a bad pick must never crash the turn.
