"""
passes/director/direction_note.py -- Direction-note step.

Asks the model, via a forced ``record_direction_note`` call, whether anything from
this turn should persist for the rest of the branch. Gated by the master Writing
switch and the enabled ``field_type='direction_note'`` fragments whose timing matches
this placement; each filled parameter becomes one labelled note (empty when nothing is
worth recording). Issues one call for the whole timing group, or one per fragment when
the per-fragment director toggle is on.

The wire schema in the shared per-turn tool blob is the union of every direction-note
fragment, held byte-stable so every call reuses the cached base and only forces the
tool choice. A call narrows the request text and the extraction to its own fragments --
the timing group, or a single fragment when the per-fragment toggle splits the group.
The trailing depends on placement: the post-turn placement replays the writer's user
message and reply to extend the warm writer/editor prefix; the pre-writer placement
appends only the request, carrying this turn's scene direction inside it.

Errors and aborts are swallowed into an empty result. The post-turn placement runs
immediately before the turn's ``_result`` is emitted, so a propagating exception
would skip persistence of the finished reply -- recording a note must never do that.
