"""
predicates.py — Dependency-free turn predicates.

Three pure functions that answer "what mode is this turn in?":
``agent_enabled``, ``is_dual_model``, and ``resolve_persona_id``. They read
settings/conversation mappings and return a flag or id.

Sits below ``config`` (which imports the pass modules) so any module in the
package can call these without pulling in the heavier pass dependencies.
