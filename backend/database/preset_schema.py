"""Preset engine policy -- the human-decided facts the schema can't tell the engine.

The merge engine in ``backend/features/presets/engine.py`` reads the live SQLite schema and derives
every *mechanical* decision itself (merge order, id remapping, FK rewrite,
child-replace scope), so most schema changes need **no edit here**. This file holds
only the handful of facts no ``PRAGMA`` can reveal:

    which domain a table belongs to    -> DOMAIN_ROOTS
    which tables to ignore entirely     -> EXCLUDED_TABLES
    which columns are secret/personal   -> SECRET_COLUMNS  (tripwire: SENSITIVE_*)
    product rules layered on top         -> IMPLIED_DOMAINS, PRESERVED_COLUMNS

You don't have to remember when to touch them: ``tests/integration/
test_preset_schema_coverage.py`` fails the moment a migration adds a table or a
secret-looking column that isn't accounted for, and names the constant to fix. Each
section below opens with a "Touch when:" line saying exactly what to change.

Three edits that once corrupted presets *silently* -- each now has a dedicated
tripwire, so they fail loudly instead:
  * Renaming a domain value. Domains are baked into every exported file
    (``orb_preset_meta.included_domains``); a renamed domain no longer matches on
    import, so that data is silently skipped for every preset already out there.
    Add domains freely; never rename one. CAUGHT BY: a frozen-literal assertion on
    ``presets.ALL_DOMAINS`` in the coverage test -- a rename fails CI; an addition
    is a deliberate one-line test edit.
  * Parking a real data table in ``EXCLUDED_TABLES`` to quiet the test -- excluded
    tables are invisible to export *and* merge, so the data vanishes from backups.
    CAUGHT BY: a runtime tripwire in ``build_preset`` that raises if any excluded
    table other than the meta/migration bookkeeping holds rows, plus a test that
    every excluded data table is empty in the fresh schema.
  * Narrowing ``SENSITIVE_*`` to clear a flagged column -- declare the column in
    ``SECRET_COLUMNS`` instead, or the secret ships in shared presets. CAUGHT BY:
    a secret-canary test that seeds a unique sentinel into every secret column,
    exports without ``configs`` (and with ``strip_keys``), and greps the produced
    file's raw bytes for any surviving canary -- a generic leak check, not just the
    declared columns' happy path.

# a new exportable domain -- ALL_DOMAINS is derived from these); never rename one
