# Each seed entry is one of two shapes:
#   * a raw regex pattern string — matched case-insensitively against a single
#     sentence at a time (see slop_detector). Bridge loosely-related words with
#     a *bounded* gap like `\W+(\w+\W+){0,2}` (at most a couple of words) rather
#     than a bare `.*`, which greedily spans the whole sentence and over-matches.
#     Use alternation `(a|b)` for synonyms, inflection suffixes like `(s|ing|ed)`,
#     and `\b` to keep short words from matching inside larger ones.
#   * a list of literal variant strings — kept as worked examples of the literal
#     mode the editor still supports for users who prefer plain phrases.
