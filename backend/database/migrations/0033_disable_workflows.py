0033_disable_workflows -- add the workflow on/off toggles to settings.

`workflows_globally_enabled` (default 1) is a master switch over all secondary
workflows; `workflow_enabled` (default '{}') holds a per-workflow `{wid: bool}`
map where a missing key means enabled. Both default to on so existing and fresh
installs keep their current behaviour.

The format_consistency workflow previously carried its own on/off flag in its
config slot (`workflow_config.$.format_consistency.enabled`). That flag and the
new per-workflow toggle answer the same question, so the flag is retired: if the
user had explicitly turned it off, carry that disable into the new
`workflow_enabled` map and drop the stale config key. A fresh DB has no such key,
so the carry is a no-op there; a second run is a no-op because the key is gone.
