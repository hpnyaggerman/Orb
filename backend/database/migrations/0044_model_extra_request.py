"""
0044_model_extra_request -- add the per-model arbitrary request additions.

``extra_headers`` holds ``Name: value`` lines merged into the outbound HTTP
headers; ``extra_body`` holds a JSON object merged into the chat-completions
request body. Both default to '' (send nothing), so an existing model config
keeps behaving exactly as before.

They exist so a provider knob Orb has no setting for -- a routing header like
``X-Provider``, a body field a gateway added last week -- can be driven without
a code change. This generalises ``reasoning_effort_param`` /
``reasoning_effort_value``, which do the same thing but only for reasoning and
only into the body. Validation stays at the API layer (ModelConfigUpdate), not
in the DB.
