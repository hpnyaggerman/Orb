"""
0020_secondary_workflows -- schema + data migration for the secondary-workflows
feature.

Carries a 0019 -> final-shape delta and runs correctly on two entry shapes:
  - Fresh install: schema.py already creates the final shape, so every guarded
    ADD/CREATE below no-ops and only the legacy-source ports + drops do work.
  - Pre-workflow upgrade (existing main-shaped DB): the guarded ADDs fire and
    real user data is ported.

Legacy data ports (mandatory -- a real upgrade carries this data; skipping it
would silently drop user attachments and TTS configuration):
  - message_attachments rows -> user_attachments. Every pre-split row is a user
    upload, so all rows copy. message_attachments is then dropped. It is kept in
    schema.py's base schema because migration 0002 deletes from it on fresh
    install before any table-creating migration runs; removing that base
    definition crashes a fresh boot.
  - settings.tts_enabled / tts_auto_speak / tts_volume columns and the
    voice_profiles table -> settings.workflow_config["tts"] = {auto_play, volume}
    plus, per voice profile, character_cards.workflow_state["tts"] (the
    endpoint_id field is dropped -- no runtime consumer reads it). The legacy
    columns and table are then dropped.

Idempotent: every column ADD is PRAGMA-guarded, every table CREATE/DROP is
existence-guarded, and the TTS port short-circuits once the legacy sources are
gone, so a re-run (or a run on an already-final DB) is a no-op.
