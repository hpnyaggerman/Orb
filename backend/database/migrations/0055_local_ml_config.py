0055_local_ml_config -- per-local-ML-feature config blob on ``settings``.

Sibling to ``local_ml_enabled``, which answers "is this feature on"; this one
answers "and how is it configured". The first tenant is the prose rewriter,
whose choices are which checkpoint to serve, whether to offload to the GPU and
how many paragraph slots to allocate: ``{"prose_rewriter": {"variant":
"4b-q8", "gpu": true, "batch_size": 2}}``.

A JSON column rather than two more flat columns because the shape is the
feature's own business and a second variant-bearing feature must not need a
migration. Defaults to '{}', so an existing install reads every feature as
unconfigured -- which for the rewriter means "no model selected", and the
Editor pass simply does not run it.
