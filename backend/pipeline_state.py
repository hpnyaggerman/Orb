"""
pipeline_state.py — The per-turn contract dataclasses shared across passes.

These three dataclasses are the turn-state contract every pass reads: the
orchestrator builds them and the director / writer / editor passes consume them.
They live here — a focused leaf the passes point *down* into — rather than at the
top in ``orchestrator.py``, so the dependency runs one direction (passes →
pipeline_state) instead of the passes reaching up into the coordinator.

Only the dataclass *shapes* live here. Their construction and behaviour
(``_resolve_pipeline_config``, ``_make_result``, ``is_dual_model``, …) stay in
``orchestrator.py``; ``_PipelineResult`` likewise stays there, being
pipeline-internal and not consumed by any pass.

    A turn has two lanes — ``writer`` and ``agent`` (director + editor). In
    single-model mode they are the *same object* (the writer's lane is reused for
    the agent), so the byte-identity invariant "director + editor + writer ride
    the same base" is structural, not a convention each call site must honour. In

    client, its own prefix + tool blob, and the agent model; the writer lane
    carries the writer client with an empty tools blob (Invariant 5).

    ``reasoning`` stays per-pass (director and editor share the agent lane but
    toggle reasoning independently), so it is not part of the lane.
