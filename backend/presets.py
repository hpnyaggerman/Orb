"""Preset / backup engine: selective export, merge-import, full snapshots.

A *preset* is a standalone SQLite ``.db`` file holding a chosen subset of the
live database's data plus an ``orb_preset_meta`` row describing what it carries.
Snapshots are the same kind of file (a full-domain preset) and live in the same
on-disk library, so the UI lists everything uniformly.

Two ways to bring a file's data into the live DB:

  * **apply** -- merge by identity. UUID-keyed entities (characters, worlds,
    conversations, fragments) upsert; a parent's child collection (a chat's
    message tree, a world's lorebook entries) is replaced wholesale; integer-PK
    rows that are *referenced* by other tables are reinserted with fresh ids and
    the references translated. Existing data the preset doesn't mention is left
    alone.
  * **restore** -- roll the live DB back to the file. A *full-coverage* file is
    swapped in whole (``restore_full``). A *partial* file is restored
    domain-scoped (``restore_partial``): the same merge machinery as apply, but
    each covered domain is emptied first, so those domains end up *exactly*
    matching the file (rows added since are dropped) while domains the file
    doesn't carry are left untouched.

All logic here is synchronous ``sqlite3`` (mirroring the migration runner) so it
can ``ATTACH`` databases and run ``VACUUM INTO``; routes invoke it via
``asyncio.to_thread`` while holding ``backend.locks.maintenance_lock``.

    The replacement is prepared out-of-place and swapped in with an atomic
    ``os.replace``. We never write to (or delete the WAL/SHM of) the live path
    while it is open: the running app serves overlapping requests on their own
    short-lived connections, and overwriting the file or removing its ``-wal``
    out from under one leaves it holding a lock, which made the prep writes
    below fail with "database is locked". After the swap, any still-open
    connection keeps running on the now-unlinked old inode and finishes
    cleanly, while new connections see the restored file.

    The swapped-in file is in rollback (DELETE) journal mode, but the *old*
    live DB ran in WAL mode, so its ``-wal``/``-shm`` are still sitting at the
    live path beside the freshly restored file. Clearing the ``-wal`` is NOT
    cosmetic: SQLite replays a ``-wal`` it finds next to a database on open
    *regardless of that database's own journal mode* (verified on 3.45), so a
    surviving stale ``-wal`` is recovered over the restored file and silently
    reverts the restore to the previous database's contents (a truncated one
    can instead leave a malformed file). We therefore treat the removal as
    mandatory and raise if the ``-wal`` cannot be cleared, rather than letting
    a latent revert surface on the next restart.

    Residual race, not closed here: a reader that opens the live path in the
    brief window between the ``os.replace`` and the removal below can itself
    replay the stale ``-wal``. Fully closing it means gating ``get_db`` opens
    for the duration of the swap (a process-wide reader/writer barrier), which
    is out of scope for this file-swap helper.
