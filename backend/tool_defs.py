# Sent only when the audit flagged issues (banned phrases, repetitive
# openers/templates).  Contains tool-selection logic, patching rules,
# and rewriting rules.
REFINE_AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "TOOL SELECTION RULES:\n"
    "1. If there are AUDIT ISSUES (banned phrases, repetitive openers, or repetitive templates) AND NO LENGTH GUARD: Use `refine_apply_patch` to fix each issue with surgical patches.\n"
    "2. If there is a LENGTH GUARD (draft too long) AND NO AUDIT ISSUES: Use `refine_rewrite` to produce a concise rewrite within the specified limits.\n"
    "3. If there are BOTH AUDIT ISSUES AND LENGTH GUARD: Use `refine_rewrite` to address both concerns in a single comprehensive rewrite.\n\n"
    "PATCHING RULES (when using `refine_apply_patch`):\n"
    "- Send ONE `refine_apply_patch` call with one patch per flagged issue.\n"
    "- The `search` field must be copied EXACTLY from the draft text above — including all punctuation and quotes.\n"
    "- Each patch must target a DIFFERENT, non-overlapping piece of text.\n"
    "- Do NOT send a patch where `search` and `replace` are identical.\n"
    "- Keep replacements close in length to the original.\n"
    "- For banned phrases: rewrite the sentence to remove the banned phrase entirely. Note: The audit report may show the canonical phrase name (e.g., 'ozone'), but you need to remove the actual variant that appears in the sentence (e.g., 'electric').\n"
    "- For repetitive openers: change how the sentence begins.\n"
    "- For repetitive templates: restructure the sentence (reorder clauses, combine, vary syntax).\n\n"
    "REWRITING RULES (when using `refine_rewrite`):\n"
    "- Send ONE `refine_rewrite` call with the complete rewritten text.\n"
    "- Address all audit issues (if any) while also respecting length constraints.\n"
    "- Preserve the author's vocabulary and creative word choices and all key story beats.\n"
    "- First priority is to get rid of repetitiveness.\n"
    "- Be more concise but maintain coherence and narrative flow.\n\n"
    "GENERAL NOTES:\n"
    "- If the audit report seems incorrect or makes no sense, you may skip fixing those specific issues.\n"
    "- Always choose the most appropriate tool based on the combination of issues presented."
