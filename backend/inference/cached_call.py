    Holds the system+history *prefix*, the *tools* blob, and the *model*.
    Built once per server per turn; all passes on that server extend it via

    nothing can mutate or reorder the shared base mid-turn.

    In dual-model turns there are two bases — one for the writer's server, one
    for the agent (director + editor) server. The writer's base simply has an
    empty ``tools`` tuple, which is how Invariant 5 is enforced without
    threading a flag through the writer pass.

    ``resolve`` is an optional ``messages -> messages`` transform applied to
    ``[*prefix, *trailing]`` right before the call (in practice
    ``Macros.resolve_prompt_messages``, which scrubs ``{{user}}``/``{{char}}``
    from pass-appended content). The tracker snapshot is taken after resolution,
