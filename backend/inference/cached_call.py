cached_call.py — Shared completion chokepoint for every pipeline pass.

Defines :func:`cached_complete` (the single call site all passes funnel
through) and :class:`CachedBase` (the shared prefix + tools + model bottom
of the prompt stack). The KV tracker is an optional pass-in; this module has
no runtime dependency on it.

    """The shared bottom of the prompt stack for one turn on one server.

    Holds the system+history *prefix*, the *tools* blob, and the *model*.
    Built once per server per turn; all passes on that server extend it via
    :meth:`complete` rather than rebuilding it. Fields are frozen tuples so
    nothing can mutate or reorder the shared base mid-turn.

    In dual-model turns there are two bases — one for the writer's server, one
    for the agent (director + editor) server. The writer's base simply has an
    empty ``tools`` tuple, which is how Invariant 5 is enforced without
    threading a flag through the writer pass.

    ``resolve`` is an optional ``messages -> messages`` transform applied to
    ``[*prefix, *trailing]`` right before the call (in practice
    ``Macros.resolve_prompt_messages``, which scrubs ``{{user}}``/``{{char}}``
    from pass-appended content). The tracker snapshot is taken after resolution,
    so it always matches what was actually sent. ``None`` means no transform.
