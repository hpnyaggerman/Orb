"""Shared in-process CPU local-ML scaffold.

Opt-in: needs the ``requirements-ml.txt`` extras (``llama-cpp-python`` +
``huggingface_hub``) and a GGUF on disk. Base Orb never imports either — the
imports live inside functions so a stock install runs fine and each local-ML
route just 503s.

One registry (``MODELS``), one download path, and per-feature cached ``Llama``
handles. ``autocomplete`` is a text-generation model (``create_completion``);
the rest are ModernBERT sequence classifiers read through ``_head_logits`` and
differing only in how they interpret those logits — ``ascore`` softmaxes two,
``aclassify`` argmaxes 28, ``aclassify_pov`` marginalizes a 4x3 grid. A new model
reuses the download/toggle/path plumbing for free, but its *inference* path is its
own — generation and classification don't share a call. The ``available`` /
``complete`` / ``build_prompt`` / ``ascore`` names are the routes' stable surface.
