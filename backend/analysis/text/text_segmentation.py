"""
text_segmentation.py — Shared paragraph, sentence, and dialogue segmentation
used by all detectors.

Every detector used to carry its own copy of these helpers, and they had silently
drifted apart: some treated "…" as a sentence terminator and some didn't; some
recognized single curly quotes and some didn't; one was missing the
trailing-marker tolerance the others had. This module is the single source of
truth so all detectors split text the same way.

Two splitting functions serve two families of consumers:

- split_sentences — keeps dialogue intact. Used by detectors that need to match
  inside quotes (slop_detector) or analyze clause grammar (contrastive_negation).
- split_narration_sentences — strips dialogue first. Used by detectors that only
  care about narration prose (opening_monotony, template_repetition,
  phrase_repetition).

find_quote_spans and count_sentences support structural_repetition, which
classifies blocks rather than stripping them but still needs the same quote and
terminator definitions.

strip_ooc and ends_with_question support anti_echo: strip_ooc removes the
[OOC: ...] directives that aren't in-character speech, and ends_with_question
classifies a sentence by its terminator (using the same trailing-marker
tolerance as SENT_SPLIT).
