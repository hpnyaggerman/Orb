"""
lexical.py — Shared word-level helpers used across the prose-quality detectors.

These are the operations that work on individual words and token lists:
tokenizing text, normalizing a single word, sliding an n-gram window, comparing
two token sequences (longest shared run, contiguous containment), and the
content-word floor (a match is only worth flagging if it carries enough
non-stopword words). Detectors used to carry their own copies of these — the
tokenizer regex, the stopword list, the n-gram helper, the sequence comparisons —
and the copies had silently drifted apart. This module is the single source of
truth so every detector tokenizes, normalizes, and judges "content" the same way.

Note on tokenizers: slop_detector and contrastive_negation deliberately keep
their own tokenizers — slop_detector needs phrase casing and punctuation
boundaries, contrastive_negation needs punctuation tokens for clause grammar —
so they don't use tokenize()/STOPWORDS here. They do share the pure sequence
operations (ngrams(), longest_common_run(), is_contiguous_subsequence()), which
work on a token list regardless of how the tokens were produced.

Public API:
    TOKEN_RE                — the word pattern ([a-z0-9']+)
    tokenize(text)          — lowercase word tokens
    normalize_word(word)    — lowercase a word, stripped to [a-z0-9']
    ngrams(tokens, n)       — sliding window of n-word tuples over a token list
    longest_common_run(a, b)               — longest token run shared contiguously by two token lists
    is_contiguous_subsequence(short, long) — whether one token sequence is a contiguous run of another
    STOPWORDS               — function/filler words excluded from the content-word floor
    count_content_words(ts) — number of tokens in ts that are not stopwords
