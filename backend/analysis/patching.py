"""
patching.py — Pure audit-report filtering and id-anchored patch application.

Extracted from ``pipeline.passes.editor.editor`` so non-pipeline consumers
(the Document-mode auditor in ``features/documents``) can reuse them without
importing a peer slice: pipeline→analysis and features→analysis are both legal
downward edges.

Patches are anchored on the numbered findings :mod:`analysis.targets` builds,
not on a ``search`` string copied out of the draft. Application is a splice of
offsets the audit itself recorded, so the whole near-miss fallback ladder that
the string path needed (marker stripping, quote normalisation, LLM escape
artifacts) is gone along with the "Multiple matches" rejection that made a
duplicated sentence unfixable.
