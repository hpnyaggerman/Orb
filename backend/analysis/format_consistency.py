"""format_consistency.py — Keep RP markup style consistent across messages.

RP output drifts between *formatting conventions*: one message wraps action in
``*asterisks*`` and leaves speech bare, the next leaves action as bare prose and
quotes its speech. This module detects the convention of recent messages and
deterministically rewrites a new draft's markup to match — no LLM involved.

The problem is modelled as two **independent axes**, each detected by coverage
fraction rather than mere presence (so an occasional emphasized word or italic
thought inside otherwise-bare prose does not flip a whole message):

- Dialogue axis — is speech ``QUOTED`` ("…") or ``BARE``?
- Narration axis — is action/narration ``ASTERISK`` (*…*) or ``BARE`` prose?

A span's role (dialogue vs narration) is fixed by its markup plus the message's
convention, so once the axes are known the rewrite is mechanical. When an axis
can't be classified confidently — or the baseline window disagrees — that axis
is left alone, so the safe failure mode is a byte-identical no-op.
