"""
opening_monotony.py — Detect repetitive sentence openings in the assistant's response.

Flags cases like a run of four narration sentences all starting with "He" or
"She", which produces a drumbeat effect that reads as formulaic.

Public API:
    detect_opening_monotony(text, n_words=1, min_consecutive=4) -> MonotonyResult
    MonotonyResult, FlaggedOpener  (dataclasses)

Only narration sentences are checked — dialogue is stripped first so a
character repeatedly saying "I..." inside quotes doesn't trigger the detector.
Sentence splitting is paragraph-aware: a paragraph whose final sentence has no
terminator won't bleed into the next paragraph.
