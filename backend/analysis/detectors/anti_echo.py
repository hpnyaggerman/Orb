"""
anti_echo.py — Detect when the assistant parrots the user's last message back as
an incredulous question.

Some models have a habit of bouncing the user's own words back as a question:

    H: "I have absolutely no money."
    A: "Absolutely no money?" She repeats.

    H: "I got some ice cream."
    A: He blinks, "Ice cream? You're a grown man."

Unlike every other detector in this package, this is a user→assistant check: it
compares the current draft against the user's immediately-preceding message.

Public API:
    detect_anti_echo(draft, user_message, *, max_question_words=10,
                     min_content_words=1, min_coverage=0.5, short_question_words=4)
    EchoResult, FlaggedEcho  (dataclasses)

How it works:
    - Only the user's spoken dialogue (text inside quote marks, with [OOC: ...]
      asides stripped) feeds the comparison pool. The user's narration and their
      out-of-character instructions are not in-character speech and shouldn't
      trigger a flag. Each quoted span is kept as its own token list so a match
      can't bridge two separate utterances.
    - Question candidates are gathered from the draft (sentences ending in ?),
      both from inside quote spans and from narration. Quotes are split out first
      so a lead-in like "He blinks, " can't fuse onto the quoted question.
    - For each candidate, find the longest contiguous word run it shares with any
      of the user's spoken spans. Flag it when that run carries enough content
      words (non-stopwords) and either the whole question is short or the shared
      run covers most of it — so bare-stopword questions ("You?", "What?") and
      questions that just happen to reuse one of the user's nouns don't fire.
