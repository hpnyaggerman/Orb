# browser. Two separate timers kill a silent stream, and the shorter one sets
# this value:
#
# 1. The browser. When the OS reports a network change (on Linux, a
#    NetworkManager state change over D-Bus), Firefox re-verifies traffic on
#    every *active* connection and closes the ones that moved zero bytes inside
#    network.http.network-changed.timeout — 5s by default — with
#    NS_ERROR_NET_RESET. Loopback is not exempt. The page sees its fetch body
#    fail ("Error in input stream"), never a clean end, so the turn dies with
#    nothing logged on this side. A DHCPv6 lease renewal is such a change, and a
#    router handing out a short T1 fires one every minute: a 15s heartbeat left
#    gaps wide enough that turns died mid-generation several times an hour.
# 2. An idle-timeout proxy in front of Orb (nginx proxy_read_timeout defaults to
#    60s) tears down the same silent SSE, which strands the still-running
#    backend and drops the frontend to a stale draft.
#
# 3s keeps every gap inside the browser's verification window and far under
# common proxy timeouts, for ~4 bytes/s on an otherwise idle stream.
