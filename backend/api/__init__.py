"""HTTP API layer: the FastAPI app factory.

``build_app()`` assembles the application from its parts:
  - the startup ``lifespan`` (DB init, pending migrations + VACUUM, schema
    safety check),
  - the ``no_cache_middleware``,
  - every domain router under ``api/routes/`` (see ``routes.ROUTERS``), and
  - the static ``frontend/`` mount, attached **last** so concrete routes match
    before the ``/static`` catch-all.

``backend.main`` calls this and exposes the result as ``app`` so the
Dockerfiles' ``uvicorn backend.main:app`` and the integration conftest's
``from backend.main import app`` keep working.
