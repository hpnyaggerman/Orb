# Text-to-Speech

Orb can read character dialogue aloud. Speech settings are global, while each
character has its own voice.

## Playback controls

In **Settings**, configure:

- **Audio/TTS enabled**: turn speech playback on or off
- **Auto-speak**: play speech for each new assistant reply
- **Volume**: set playback volume

Select the speaker icon on an assistant reply to read it. Select a spoken line to
read only that line. Orb highlights the line currently playing.

## Character voices

Open the **Text-to-Speech** card in the tools panel, then **Settings**. Its
**Voice profile** section applies to the current conversation's character only,
and sets:

- Whether the voice is enabled
- Backend and connection settings
- Language and voice
- Speed and pitch
- Preview playback

In a group chat, choose a **Cast member** in the Voice panel. Each reply uses the
voice of the member who wrote it, regardless of which member is selected in the
panel.

### Cloning a voice

**Spark-TTS (built-in)** replaces the voice picker with a drop zone. Drop an
audio file of the character speaking onto it — or select it to pick a file — and
that character speaks in that voice from then on. There is no server to run and
nothing else to press: the clip enrols as it lands, and Orb points the profile
at the built-in backend and switches this character's speech on for you. Use
**Preview** to hear the result, and **Remove voice** to forget it, which also
stops the automatic speech that enrolling turned on.

When a required download or switch is missing, the control says which and fixes
it in place. It installs the codec first, so a voice can be enrolled while the
shared runtime and voice model download. Once ready, it also shows the model's
**Run on GPU** switch and load state. None of this appears under **Settings →
Local ML**: the cloned-voice control is the only place the cloner is managed.

The **whole clip, up to two minutes**, is considered. Orb removes silent edges
and shortens long silent gaps before enrollment, so scene transitions do not
dilute the voice signal. The cloned voice shifts with which few seconds it
hears, so a clip of several lines leaves less to chance than one line does. A
clip under six seconds after silence cleanup is repeated to fill six. **Clean
audio matters more than length:** music or ambience under the voice costs more
than extra seconds recover, so prefer a short clean clip to a long noisy one.
One speaker only.

What is stored is 32 integers — the speaker's timbre as the model encodes it —
which live in the character's voice profile and travel with it. The uploaded
clip is used only for enrollment; the compact tokens are all synthesis needs.

**Speed and pitch do not apply to a cloned voice**, and the panel hides them.
Spark-TTS accepts prosody attributes only when it is inventing a speaker; a
cloned voice takes its delivery from the model, not from a slider. Timbre
transfers; pacing does not.

Enrollment reads WAV and FLAC out of the box. MP3, M4A and anything else need
`ffmpeg` on your `PATH`; without it, convert the clip to WAV first.

## How speech is made

1. Orb reads the message's dialogue/narration convention with the same markup
   classifier used by Format Consistency, when that Local ML model is available
   and enabled. Otherwise it uses the shared format heuristics. This works
   independently of whether the Format Consistency workflow is enabled.
2. Shared quote and emphasis segmentation selects speech. It recognizes quoted
   dialogue and bare dialogue between marked action beats, including underscore
   beats and inline emphasis. Recognized action beats such as `*laughs*` can
   become pauses or emotion tags for compatible backends.
3. The selected backend synthesizes each speech block. The browser plays the
   audio and highlights its words. Orb caches generated audio for replay.

Orb recognizes straight, curly, guillemet, CJK, fullwidth, and other supported
Unicode quote pairs. Paired em-dash dialogue supports consecutive lines at prose
boundaries, including inline emphasis within each line.
Inline narrative dash asides are left out. Parenthetical asides, OOC notes,
protected formatting (code fences, bold runs and dividers), and recognized
attributed thoughts are excluded. Ordinary parentheses inside dialogue remain
spoken.

The classifier identifies a whole-message convention, not the speaker or the
role of every sentence. For unmarked chat such as `Hello. Let's get to know each
other.`, it can return `unknown` for both conventions. TTS reads that plain text
as speech, while still excluding text positively classified as narration. This
fallback requires the model's reading; the heuristic fallback alone cannot
reliably recognize plain chat. Mixed bare narration and speech cannot always be
separated reliably: speech selection follows the classified convention, without
discarding bare dialogue merely because it begins with words such as “The” or
“She”. An ambiguous unmarked narrative may also be read. TTS does not
infer different speakers inside one reply. Voice previews read their literal
input without dialogue extraction.

New audio attachments save the exact synthesis chunks in
`generation_metadata.speech_chunks`, and each playback block includes
`consumption_metadata.blocks[].spoken_text`. Replay uses those saved chunks
without rerunning the classifier, and highlighting uses the stored spoken text.
Older attachments retain their original extraction rules for replay; regenerating
an attachment applies the current segmentation and Local ML settings.

### The built-in backend

**Spark-TTS (built-in)** is the only backend that needs no server. Install the
optional ML extras (`pip install -r requirements-ml.txt`), then download its
pieces from the cloned-voice control:

- **Voice model** (520 MB) — speaks. Runs through the same llama-server runtime
  as the Prose Rewriter and has the same **Run on GPU** switch; it is the half
  that benefits from the GPU build. Changing the switch takes effect on the next
  spoken line.
- **Voice codec** (391 MB, two files) — turns an uploaded clip into a voice and
  voices back into audio. CPU only; ONNX Runtime has no Vulkan provider, and the
  vocoder is not the bottleneck.
- **Reference reader** (491 MB) — turns a short excerpt into the semantic tokens
  used by Advanced cloning. It runs on the CPU and is only needed while enrolling
  a voice.
- **Speech recognizer** (250 MB) — transcribes that excerpt so Advanced cloning
  can copy its delivery. It runs on the CPU and is only needed while enrolling.
- **llama-server runtime** (about 150 MB) — shared with the Prose Rewriter and
  fetched automatically when the voice model needs it.

The codec and voice model download separately, and Basic cloning can enrol a
voice as soon as the codec is present. Advanced cloning downloads the reference
reader and speech recognizer as well; those two are used only during enrollment,
so an already prepared Advanced voice can still speak when they are unloaded or
disabled. The voice model is unloaded after a couple of minutes idle so it does
not hold VRAM against a local Writer or the Prose Rewriter.

#### Built-in cloner implementation notes

An enrolled voice is 32 BiCodec global-token indices stored in the character's
TTS profile. Orb decodes an uploaded clip only while enrolling it and never
stores the audio. Profiles created for the former `spark` sidecar backend are
migrated to `spark_remote`; new `spark` profiles select the built-in cloner.

Basic cloning transfers timbre only. Advanced cloning also keeps a short excerpt
and its transcript, allowing Spark-TTS to continue the reference speaker's
delivery. Orb stores the excerpt as semantic tokens and never stores the
uploaded audio; if transcription is incomplete, the panel lets you listen to
the reconstructed excerpt and type the exact transcript.

The codec artifacts have separate responsibilities:

- The speaker encoder is a small CPU-only ONNX graph. It reads a 16 kHz mel
  spectrogram and produces the 32 global-token indices used for enrollment.
- The decoder is also CPU-only ONNX. It turns generated semantic-token indices
  and the enrolled global tokens into 16 kHz PCM.

A llama-server child generates the semantic tokens from the 0.5B GGUF. It is
the only cloner component affected by **Run on GPU**, and is released after
inactivity. The shared llama-server runtime is obtained through the generic
Local ML runtime route; the Prose Rewriter uses that runtime too, but does not
own it.

All BiCodec tokens are GGUF control tokens, so llama-server receives an integer
prompt and returns generated token IDs; Orb does not parse completion text. The
pinned token ranges are:

| Family | Index range | Token-ID range |
|---|---:|---:|
| global | 0–4095 | 151665–155760 |
| semantic | 0–8191 | 155761–163952 |

Orb tokenizes user text with special-token parsing disabled and ignores any
generated IDs outside the semantic range before decoding. `UBATCH_SIZE = 8` is
a correctness limit for the pinned llama.cpp Vulkan build: larger prompt
batches can corrupt the model's prompt. Do not raise it without an end-to-end
audio regression check.

The mel parameters and volume normalization match Spark-TTS. After volume
normalization, silent edges are removed and interior silence longer than 300 ms
is shortened to 200 ms. References shorter than six seconds after that cleanup
are tiled to six seconds; longer clips are retained up to the two-minute limit,
because clean additional speech yields a more stable speaker representation.
Generated clips also have silent edges removed before playback, leaving the
workflow's designed inter-block gap as the only pause between blocks. WAV, FLAC,
and OGG use the optional audio dependency; other formats use `ffmpeg` when
available. To regenerate the speaker-encoder ONNX artifact, run
`scripts/export_spark_speaker_encoder.py`. A replacement must preserve the
32-token output contract and update the catalog checksum and enrollment golden
test.

### Local server backends

Kokoro-82M, Spark-TTS (sidecar), and Fish Speech run as local servers. Orb ships
the client, not the server: run one yourself, then point that voice's **API URL**
at it.

Kokoro-82M (default `http://localhost:9200`) and Spark-TTS's sidecar (default
`http://localhost:9300`) each expose:

- `GET /v1/voices` — returns `[{id, name, language, gender}]`
- `POST /v1/tts` — returns WAV

Their request bodies differ. Kokoro takes `{text, voice, speed, lang}`, where
`lang` is its own single-letter code (`a` for American English, `b` for
British, and so on). Spark-TTS takes `{text, voice, speed, pitch, lang}`, where
`lang` is a full locale. Voice profiles saved before the built-in backend
existed keep working: they are moved to **Spark-TTS (sidecar)** automatically
and still point at the server you already run. Fish Speech uses its own native API instead: `POST
/v1/tts` keyed by `reference_id`, and `GET /v1/references/list`.

Orb sends one request per speech block and joins the clips itself, inserting
real silence for pauses, so a server only ever synthesizes one block at a time.
`speed` and `pitch` arrive as float multipliers where `1.0` means the voice's
own level.

## Add a backend

Backends live in `backend/workflows/tts/engine/` and implement the `TTSAdapter` base class. The
router registers an adapter when its dependencies are available. Implement
`list_voices()`, `list_models()` when needed, and `synthesize()`, plus the adapter
metadata properties. `backend/workflows/tts/engine/edge_adapter.py` is a reference.
