# Secondary Workflows

A workflow is an optional feature that plugs into Orb without adding feature
logic to the core turn pipeline. It is a Python record in a process-local
registry, plus any hooks, state, attachments, and frontend code it needs.

Built-in examples are `tts`, `image_gen`, and `format_consistency`.

## What a workflow can do

A workflow may:

- add work before or after a generated turn;
- expose a conversation-scoped action or a conversation-less query;
- produce an attachment for a message and later regenerate, reroll, rehydrate,
  activate, or delete it;
- keep state at conversation, message, character, or global config scope;
- register frontend cards, buttons, widgets, SSE handlers, audio, text effects,
  or click actions.

The framework owns registration, routing, persistence, locks, and common UI
chrome. The workflow owns its feature logic.

## Where things live

### Backend

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/workflows/registry.py` | Workflow records, subscriptions, lookups, and state access |
| `backend/workflows/contracts.py` | Hook types, context dataclasses, and `ToolSpec` |
| `backend/workflows/toolkit.py` | Stable imports for workflow authors |
| `backend/workflows/attachment_cache.py` | Attachment storage, variants, budget, and eviction |
| `backend/workflows/__init__.py` | Built-in registration and hook subscriptions |
| `backend/pipeline/workflow_bridge.py` | Pipeline hook dispatch and attachment staging |
| `backend/api/routes/workflows.py` | Workflow and attachment routes |

Each workflow has a directory such as `backend/workflows/tts/`.

### Frontend

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/workflow_api.js` | Public plugin facade |
| `frontend/workflow_loader.js` | Loads one module per manifest entry |
| `frontend/state.js` | Workflow registries and UI state |
| `frontend/chat.js` | SSE dispatch, widgets, cards, and refetching |
| `frontend/workflows/<id>/index.js` | Workflow entry point |
| `frontend/default_widget.js` | Fallback image, audio, video, or download view |

Frontend workflow code imports `/static/workflow_api.js` and its own relative
modules. It should not import core frontend modules directly.

## Declare and register a workflow

The workflow module declares data. The package-level `backend/workflows/__init__.py`
registers it and binds its hooks.

```python
Workflow(
    id="my_workflow",
    display_name="My workflow",
    tools=[],
    config_defaults={},
    config_schema=None,
    produces_artifacts=False,
)
```

`id` is the boundary key used in URLs, JSON, tools, and static module paths.
Tool names must be unique and must agree across `ToolSpec.name`, the schema,
and `tool_choice`.

Registration follows this shape:

```python
register_workflow(my_workflow)
subscribe(my_workflow.id, HookType.POST_PIPELINE, post_pipeline)
finalize_registry()
```

`finalize_registry()` verifies that an artifact-producing workflow has both
regeneration hooks. Registration order determines manifest order and is stable
on re-registration.

### Hook types

| Hook | Runs | Return shape |
|---|---|---|
| `PRE_PIPELINE` | During a turn, before the main passes; all hooks in priority order | Async stream of events or pipeline instructions |
| `POST_PIPELINE` | During a turn, after the main passes; all hooks in priority order | Async stream of events, draft changes, state, or attachments |
| `ON_DEMAND` | Conversation-scoped trigger route | One response object |
| `REGENERATE` | Attachment regeneration route | A list of new attachment records |
| `REROLL_GEN` | Attachment reroll and rehydrate routes | Bytes, or bytes plus consumption metadata |
| `QUERY` | Global configuration/discovery route | One response object |

`QUERY` has no conversation or LLM client. It is for setup and discovery, such
as checking an external server before a conversation exists. The message-level
regenerate route reruns the normal turn pipeline; `REGENERATE` is only for an
attachment.

## Enablement

The settings row is the source of truth:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `workflows_globally_enabled` | Master switch |
| `workflow_enabled` | JSON map of per-workflow overrides; missing means enabled |

Effective state is `global_on AND local_on`. The backend applies it to pipeline
hooks and hook-firing routes. Config, manifest, query, and attachment-consumption
routes remain available so a disabled workflow can be configured and existing
attachments can still be viewed.

The frontend mirrors the same predicate and hides disabled workflow controls.
Existing attachment renderers remain available by design.

## Hook contexts

Contexts are frozen dataclasses. Their mutable fields are read-only views, with
two deliberate exceptions: `turn_scratch` and the service objects used by the
framework.

| Context | Provides | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PreCtx` | Conversation, history, current user text, settings, prefix, tool map, client, cache tracker | `turn_scratch` is shared with PostCtx |
| `PostCtx` | Conversation, final history, effective user text, Director output, merged tools, prefix, client, cache tracker | May stage a draft, state, or attachment |
| `OnDemandCtx` | Conversation, history, current user text, settings, client, character | Trigger actions |
| `RegenCtx` | Conversation, message and attachment ids, pre-anchor history, settings, client, character | Attachment regeneration |
| `RerollGenCtx` | Conversation, message and attachment ids, settings, client, prior consumption metadata, `replay` | Shared by reroll and rehydrate |
| `QueryCtx` | Settings | No conversation and no client |

For group work, `character` identifies the relevant speaker. A
`RerollGenCtx` with `replay=True` reproduces stored generation parameters;
`replay=False` lets a new variant use current workflow settings.

## State and locks

State is JSON-backed and accessed through the toolkit. Use a matching lock for
read-modify-write operations.

| State | Scope | Lock |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_state` | Conversation + workflow | `workflow_state_lock(cid, wid)` |
| `workflow_message_state` | Message + workflow | Owning conversation lock |
| `workflow_character_state` | Character + workflow | Conversation lock, then `workflow_character_state_lock` |
| `workflow_config` | Workflow | `workflow_config_lock()` |
| Attachments | Root attachment group | Framework's root lock |

The required import surface is `backend.workflows.toolkit`. It provides the LLM
client and prompt helpers, read-only database queries, state getters/setters,
`forced_tool_call`, attachment insertion, and the workflow locks. Mutating core
database helpers are intentionally not exposed to workflows.

## A workflow inside a turn

The bridge gives every turn one scratch dictionary, client, cache tracker, and
schema override map. It then follows this flow:

```text
PRE_PIPELINE hooks
        ↓
Director → Writer → Editor
        ↓
POST_PIPELINE hooks
        ↓
persist assistant message, state, and attachments
        ↓
SSE done
```

Pre-hooks can add system blocks, enable tools, or emit public events. Post-hooks
can replace the draft, set message state, stage attachments, or emit public
events. Hooks run in subscription priority order. A hook failure is isolated so
the main reply and other workflows can continue.

Use `forced_tool_call` for a one-shot tool call. Pass the context's prefix,
enabled tools, schema overrides, client, and cache tracker so the call follows
the same prompt and cache rules as the main turn.

Public hook events pass through to SSE. Core events and names beginning with
`_` are reserved. A useful custom event is `phase_status` with a channel that
starts with `workflow:<id>`.

## Attachments

Artifact-producing workflows write through `insert_workflow_attachment` or
yield an `attach_artifact` instruction from `POST_PIPELINE`. An attachment has
a workflow id, filename, MIME type, and exactly one byte source (`data` or
`path`). The framework validates it before persistence.

Attachments are arranged as a flat variant group: one root and its siblings.
The active sibling is user-selectable. The cache stores bytes in
`workflow_attachments` and enforces a configurable byte budget. When space is
needed, older accessed rows are evicted by replacing their bytes with the
`[evicted]` marker.

Supply a seed and JSON generation metadata when an artifact can be recreated.
That lets the user rehydrate evicted bytes. The same `REROLL_GEN` hook handles:

- **reroll** — a new seed and a new sibling using current settings;
- **rehydrate** — the stored seed and parameters, restoring the same row.

`REGENERATE` also creates siblings, while `activate` and `delete` only change
the variant group. Existing artifacts remain readable when their workflow is
disabled.

## HTTP surface

The framework exposes:

```text
GET  /api/workflows
GET  /api/workflows/{wid}/config
PUT  /api/workflows/{wid}/config
POST /api/workflows/{wid}/enabled
POST /api/workflows/{wid}/query
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/workflows/{wid}/trigger
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/regenerate
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/reroll-gen
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/rehydrate
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/activate
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/delete
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/workflow-attachments/access
```

The manifest returns workflow identity and config form metadata. Config is a
full replacement; a workflow's `config_normalizer` owns its valid shape and is
used on both read and write.

## Frontend integration

At boot, the frontend fetches the manifest and imports
`/static/workflows/<id>/index.js` for each entry. Top-level registration calls
run when the module loads.

The facade in `workflow_api.js` is the frontend ABI. It is additive-only: new
exports may be added, but existing names and signatures do not change. Common
registration points are:

```js
registerWorkflowInspectorCard(wid, render)
registerWorkflowToolsPanelCard(wid, render)
registerWorkflowMessageButton(wid, render)
registerWorkflowEventHandler(wid, event, handler)
registerAttachmentRenderer(wid, render)
registerWorkflowPipeline({ id: wid, passes })
registerTextEffect({ id, label })
registerClickHandler({ id, claims, onClick })
```

Use `registerAttachmentRenderer` for the workflow's own widgets. It is not
enablement-gated so stored artifacts remain visible. Other workflow-owned cards,
buttons, and event handlers are gated by workflow id.

Buttons and inputs use delegated actions rather than globals or inline event
handlers:

```html
<button data-wf-action="my_workflow:refresh">Refresh</button>
```

```js
registerAction("my_workflow", "refresh", (element, event) => { /* ... */ });
```

The facade also provides API helpers, modal and notification helpers, workflow
phases, shared audio controls, text effects, message access, group cast data,
and conversation repaint/refetch helpers.

## Authoring checklist

1. Create `backend/workflows/<id>/` and declare a `Workflow` record.
2. Implement hooks with the context and return shapes above.
3. Register the workflow and subscriptions in
   `backend/workflows/__init__.py`.
4. Use the toolkit and matching locks for state changes.
5. If producing artifacts, implement `REGENERATE` and `REROLL_GEN`, and store
   recovery metadata where rehydrate is useful.
6. Create `frontend/workflows/<id>/index.js` and import only the facade plus
   relative modules.
7. Register only non-reserved SSE events and use `data-wf-action` for controls.
8. Add config defaults/schema and normalize the effective config if needed.
