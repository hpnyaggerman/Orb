# Secondary Workflows

A workflow is an optional feature that plugs into Orb without adding feature
logic to the core turn pipeline. It is a Python record in a process-local
registry, plus any hooks, state, attachments, and frontend code it needs.

Built-in examples are `prose_rewriter`, `tts`, `image_gen`, and
`format_consistency`.

## What a workflow can do

A workflow may:

- add work before or after a generated turn;
- expose a conversation-scoped action or a conversation-less query;
- produce an attachment for a message and later regenerate, reroll, rehydrate,
  activate, or delete it;
- keep state at conversation, message, character, or global config scope;
- register frontend cards, buttons, widgets, SSE handlers, audio, text effects,
  or click actions.

The framework owns registration, routing, persistence, locks, and common UI
chrome. The workflow owns its feature logic.

## Where things live

### Backend

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/workflows/registry.py` | Workflow records, subscriptions, lookups, and state access |
| `backend/workflows/contracts.py` | Hook types, context dataclasses, and `ToolSpec` |
| `backend/workflows/toolkit.py` | Stable imports for workflow authors |
| `backend/prompting/tool_catalog.py` | Ordered tool lookup and workflow-tool registration |
| `backend/workflows/attachment_cache.py` | Attachment storage, variants, budget, and eviction |
| `backend/workflows/__init__.py` | Built-in registration and hook subscriptions |
| `backend/pipeline/workflow_bridge.py` | Pipeline hook dispatch and attachment staging |
| `backend/api/routes/workflows.py` | Workflow and attachment routes |

Each workflow has a directory such as `backend/workflows/tts/`.

Code under `backend/workflows/<id>/` is a plug-in slice. It may import its own
package and `backend.workflows.toolkit`, but not other framework modules,
application layers, or peer workflows. Root modules directly under
`backend/workflows/` are host adapters and own the integration with prompting,
inference, persistence, and the pipeline. The toolkit must be consumed through
explicit names in its literal `__all__`; wildcard imports, importing the module
object, and private names are rejected. The backend layer checker enforces this
boundary.

### What belongs in `analysis/` and what belongs in the workflow

`analysis/` answers questions about text that more than one consumer asks.
A workflow owns the policy it applies to those answers: which reading wins,
what to change, and what to report.

`format_consistency` is the worked example. Reading a message's roleplay
markup is shared — `analysis/text/markup.py` classifies the dialogue and
narration axes for markup repair, for TTS speech selection, and for the image
camera's narration extraction, and `analysis/text/roleplay.py` and
`analysis/text/roleplay_segmentation.py` hold the span parser all three read.
Repair is not shared: `workflows/format_consistency/normalization.py` owns the
baseline window vote, the rewrite rules, the skip policy, and
`FormatDriftReport`. Nothing outside the workflow imports them, and the toolkit
does not re-export them — a toolkit entry would hand another plug-in this
workflow's repair policy by accident and would import the workflow back into
its own API.

The line to apply to a new workflow: publish through the toolkit the
primitives a plug-in needs to act on shared text, and keep in the workflow the
decisions only that feature makes.

### Frontend

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/workflow_api.js` | Public plugin facade |
| `frontend/workflow_loader.js` | Loads one module per manifest entry |
| `frontend/state.js` | Workflow registries and UI state |
| `frontend/chat.js` | SSE dispatch, widgets, cards, and refetching |
| `frontend/workflows/<id>/index.js` | Workflow entry point |
| `frontend/default_widget.js` | Fallback image, audio, video, or download view |

Frontend workflow code imports `/static/workflow_api.js` and its own relative
modules. It should not import core frontend modules directly.

## Declare and register a workflow

The workflow module declares data. The package-level `backend/workflows/__init__.py`
registers it and binds its hooks.

```python
Workflow(
    id="my_workflow",
    display_name="My workflow",
    tools=[],
    config_defaults={},
    config_schema=None,
    produces_artifacts=False,
)
```

`id` is the boundary key used in URLs, JSON, tools, and static module paths.
Tool names must be unique and must agree across `ToolSpec.name`, the schema,
and `tool_choice`.

Workflow tools append after the fixed built-in tool order. Re-registering an
existing tool replaces its contract without changing its position; removing a
tool on workflow replacement removes it through the framework-owned catalog
API. The catalog itself is not part of the plug-in API.

Registration follows this shape:

```python
register_workflow(my_workflow)
subscribe(my_workflow.id, HookType.POST_PIPELINE, post_pipeline)
finalize_registry()
```

`finalize_registry()` verifies that an artifact-producing workflow has both
regeneration hooks. Registration order determines manifest order and is stable
on re-registration.

### Hook types

| Hook | Runs | Return shape |
|---|---|---|
| `PRE_PIPELINE` | During a turn, before the main passes; all hooks in priority order | Async stream of events or pipeline instructions |
| `POST_PIPELINE` | During a turn, after the main passes; all hooks in priority order | Async stream of events, draft changes, state, or attachments |
| `ON_DEMAND` | Conversation-scoped trigger route | One response object |
| `REGENERATE` | Attachment regeneration route | A list of new attachment records |
| `REROLL_GEN` | Attachment reroll and rehydrate routes | Bytes, or bytes plus consumption metadata |
| `QUERY` | Global configuration/discovery route | One response object |

`QUERY` has no conversation or LLM client. It is for setup and discovery, such
as checking an external server before a conversation exists. The message-level
regenerate route reruns the normal turn pipeline; `REGENERATE` is only for an
attachment.

## Enablement

The settings row is the source of truth:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `workflows_globally_enabled` | Master switch |
| `workflow_enabled` | JSON map of per-workflow overrides; missing means enabled |

Effective state is `global_on AND local_on`. The backend applies it to pipeline
hooks and hook-firing routes. Config, manifest, query, and attachment-consumption
routes remain available so a disabled workflow can be configured and existing
attachments can still be viewed.

The frontend mirrors the same predicate and hides disabled workflow controls.
Existing attachment renderers remain available by design.

## Hook contexts

Contexts are frozen dataclasses. Their mutable fields are read-only views, with
two deliberate exceptions: `turn_scratch` and the service objects used by the
framework.

| Context | Provides | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PreCtx` | Conversation, history, current user text, settings, prefix, tool map, client, cache tracker | `turn_scratch` is shared with PostCtx |
| `PostCtx` | Conversation, final history, effective user text, Director output, merged tools, prefix, client, cache tracker, resolved Agent execution target (`agent_client`, `agent_model_name`) | May stage a draft, state, or attachment |
| `OnDemandCtx` | Conversation, history, current user text, settings, client, character | Trigger actions |
| `RegenCtx` | Conversation, message and attachment ids, pre-anchor history, settings, client, character, `phase(label)` | Attachment regeneration |
| `RerollGenCtx` | Conversation, message and attachment ids, settings, client, prior consumption metadata, `replay` | Shared by reroll and rehydrate |
| `QueryCtx` | Settings | No conversation and no client |

For group work, `character` identifies the relevant speaker. A
`RerollGenCtx` with `replay=True` reproduces stored generation parameters;
`replay=False` lets a new variant use current workflow settings.

## State and locks

State is JSON-backed and accessed through the toolkit. Use a matching lock for
read-modify-write operations.

| State | Scope | Lock |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_state` | Conversation + workflow | `workflow_state_lock(cid, wid)` |
| `workflow_message_state` | Message + workflow | Owning conversation lock |
| `workflow_character_state` | Character + workflow | Conversation lock, then `workflow_character_state_lock` |
| `workflow_config` | Workflow | `workflow_config_lock()` |
| Attachments | Root attachment group | Framework's root lock |

The primary runtime import surface is `backend.workflows.toolkit`. Hook contexts
carry the LLM clients; the toolkit provides semantic host operations, read-only
database queries, state getters/setters, `forced_tool_call`, attachment
insertion, and workflow locks. Raw prompting, inference, and tool-catalog
objects are intentionally not exposed to plug-ins. Mutating core database
helpers are also excluded.

## A workflow inside a turn

The bridge gives every turn one scratch dictionary, client, cache tracker, and
schema override map. It then follows this flow:

```text
PRE_PIPELINE hooks
        ↓
Director → Writer → Editor
        ↓
retain post-Editor draft
        ↓
POST_PIPELINE hooks
  Prose Rewriter (-20)
  Format Consistency (-10)
  later text/artifact hooks (0+)
        ↓
persist assistant message, state, and attachments
        ↓
SSE done
```

Pre-hooks can add system blocks, enable tools, or emit public events. Post-hooks
can replace the draft, set message state, stage attachments, or emit public
events. Hooks run in subscription priority order. The Prose Rewriter is a
registered post-hook; its negative priority puts it before Format Consistency
and artifact workflows. Its standard workflow toggle turns the rewriter on for
both automatic runs and the saved-message rewrite route, and its `automatic`
config gates the post-hook alone. Its workflow card manages the model through
the generic Local ML routes, which also own the shared llama-server runtime.
A hook failure is isolated so the main reply and other workflows can continue.

Use `forced_tool_call` for a one-shot tool call. Pass the context's prefix,
enabled tools, schema overrides, client, and cache tracker so the call follows
the same prompt and cache rules as the main turn. Its budget is the Agent lane's
configured `max_tokens`, unchanged; a workflow does not pick its own.

Public hook events pass through to SSE. Core events and names beginning with
`_` are reserved. A useful custom event is `phase_status` with a channel that
starts with `workflow:<id>`. On a turn stream its label becomes the status
bar's text for the running step, so keep it a short description of the work
(`Rewriting prose…`); outside a turn it shows as a separate pill.

## Attachments

Artifact-producing workflows write through `insert_workflow_attachment` or
yield an `attach_artifact` instruction from `POST_PIPELINE`. An attachment has
a workflow id, filename, MIME type, and exactly one byte source (`data` or
`path`). The framework validates it before persistence.

Attachments are arranged as a flat variant group: one root and its siblings.
The active sibling is user-selectable. The cache stores bytes in
`workflow_attachments` and enforces a configurable byte budget. When space is
needed, older accessed rows are evicted by replacing their bytes with the
`[evicted]` marker.

The message listing (`GET /api/conversations/{cid}/messages`) carries each
attachment without its bytes: every other column, plus `evicted` (1 when the
bytes are the marker). Bytes load from the content routes below, which answer
with an ETag the browser revalidates, support byte ranges, and return 410 for
an evicted row. A frontend widget builds the URL with `workflowAttachmentUrl`;
audio plays through `playAudio` segments of `{ row }`, or
`{ row, byte_start, byte_end }` for one clip packed inside a larger attachment.

Supply a seed and JSON generation metadata when an artifact can be recreated.
That lets the user rehydrate evicted bytes. The same `REROLL_GEN` hook handles:

- **reroll** — a new seed and a new sibling using current settings;
- **rehydrate** — the stored seed and parameters, restoring the same row.

`REGENERATE` also creates siblings, while `activate` and `delete` only change
the variant group. Existing artifacts remain readable when their workflow is
disabled.

## HTTP surface

The framework exposes:

```text
GET  /api/workflows
GET  /api/workflows/{wid}/config
PUT  /api/workflows/{wid}/config
POST /api/workflows/{wid}/enabled
POST /api/workflows/{wid}/query
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/workflows/{wid}/trigger
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/regenerate
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/reroll-gen
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/rehydrate
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/activate
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/delete
GET  /api/conversations/{cid}/messages/{mid}/workflow-attachments/{aid}/in-flight
POST /api/conversations/{cid}/workflow-attachments/access
GET  /api/workflow-attachments/{aid}/content
```

User uploads have the same split: `GET /api/user-attachments/{aid}/content`.

`in-flight` reports `{"in_flight": bool}` for the attachment's canonical root:
whether a request still holds the group's lock. Regenerate, reroll-gen,
rehydrate, and delete hold that lock for their whole duration and release it
only after their write commits, so `false` means nothing in flight can still
change the group. It exists for a client whose own connection died mid-render,
which otherwise cannot tell a running render from one the server already failed.
A single `false` does not prove failure -- a queued request has not reached the
lock yet -- so clients confirm it across consecutive polls.

With `Accept: text/event-stream`, `regenerate` streams each `ctx.phase(label)` as
`phase_status`, then `regenerate_done` (the JSON body) or `regenerate_error`
(`{status, detail}`). The render outlives a dropped stream.

The manifest returns workflow identity and config form metadata. Config is a
full replacement; a workflow's `config_normalizer` owns its valid shape and is
used on both read and write.

## Frontend integration

At boot, the frontend fetches the manifest and imports
`/static/workflows/<id>/index.js` for each entry. Top-level registration calls
run when the module loads.

The facade in `workflow_api.js` is the frontend ABI. It is additive-only: new
exports may be added, but existing names and signatures do not change. Common
registration points are:

```js
registerWorkflowInspectorCard(wid, render)
registerWorkflowToolsPanelCard(wid, render)
registerWorkflowMessageButton(wid, render)
registerWorkflowEventHandler(wid, event, handler)
registerAttachmentRenderer(wid, render)
registerWorkflowPipeline({ id: wid, passes })
registerTextEffect({ id, label })
registerClickHandler({ id, claims, onClick })
```

Use `registerAttachmentRenderer` for the workflow's own widgets. It is not
enablement-gated so stored artifacts remain visible. Other workflow-owned cards,
buttons, and event handlers are gated by workflow id.

Buttons and inputs use delegated actions rather than globals or inline event
handlers:

```html
<button data-wf-action="my_workflow:refresh">Refresh</button>
```

```js
registerAction("my_workflow", "refresh", (element, event) => { /* ... */ });
```

The facade also provides API helpers, modal and notification helpers, workflow
phases, shared audio controls, text effects, message access, group cast data,
and conversation repaint/refetch helpers.

## Authoring checklist

1. Create `backend/workflows/<id>/` and declare a `Workflow` record.
2. Implement hooks with the context and return shapes above.
3. Register the workflow and subscriptions in
   `backend/workflows/__init__.py`.
4. Use the toolkit and matching locks for state changes.
5. If producing artifacts, implement `REGENERATE` and `REROLL_GEN`, and store
   recovery metadata where rehydrate is useful.
6. Create `frontend/workflows/<id>/index.js` and import only the facade plus
   relative modules.
7. Register only non-reserved SSE events and use `data-wf-action` for controls.
8. Add config defaults/schema and normalize the effective config if needed.
