// Keyed child reconciliation for containers rendered from HTML strings.
//
// Assigning `innerHTML` throws away every child, even the ones whose markup did
// not change: CSS entrance animations replay across the whole list, images and
// scroll anchors are rebuilt, and every node has to be laid out again. This
// keeps the nodes whose markup is byte-identical to the previous pass and
// touches only the rows that actually differ.

// Two rules follow from reuse, and a caller that breaks either gets a node that
// outlives what it says. A row's html must be a pure function of that row: read
// a neighbour to build it and the neighbour can change without the html
// changing, so the stale node is kept. And a kept node may be *decorated* in
// place (spans, chips, widget state -- surviving a repaint is the point) but
// never rewritten to markup this module would not produce for the same html,
// because the signature below, not the DOM, decides what counts as unchanged.

// container -> Map(key -> html string produced for it last pass).

 * Sync `container`'s children to `entries` — `[{ key, html }]`, in document
 * order. Each `html` must have exactly one root element. Children that this
 * function did not create are removed, matching the `innerHTML` assignment
 * callers replace with it, so anything the caller re-attaches afterwards (a
 * badge, a streaming bubble) still lands last.
 *
 * A row whose html is unchanged keeps its existing DOM node, untouched. A row
 * that changed is rebuilt and, since it replaces a node that was already on
 * screen, gets `swapClass` so the caller's CSS can skip the entrance animation
 * for an in-place update while genuinely new rows still animate.
 *
 * Returns the elements built this pass, so the caller can restrict per-node
 * work (measuring, observers) to just those.
