"""The public-profile join: one renderer, one key set, one meaning for ``""``.

``render_public_profile`` lives beside ``set_public_profile`` (its only writer)
in ``database/queries/character_cards.py``, and the group cast projection
delegates to it. These pins exist because the two halves failing to agree on the
key set is silent: a field would be stored and never rendered, or rendered from
a key nothing writes.
