test_phrase_repetition_integration.py — Regression test for exact phrase
repetition detection through the _run_contextual_audit integration path.

The phrase_repetition detector is a cross-message check: it flags distinctive
n-grams that the current draft echoes from previous assistant messages. It runs
with require_last_message=True, so only phrases present in the draft surface.
