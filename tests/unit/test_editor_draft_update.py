"""The editor's ReAct loop over id-anchored patches.

One draft mutation per iteration → one draft_update per iteration, on both
transports (the text-mode per-finding prefill path is gone; text endpoints
grammar-constrain the same single call from the tool schema instead).

Also pins the two things the id method made load-bearing: the ids the model
answers with are the ones from the report it was shown, and a re-audit
renumbers them with the change stated to the model.
