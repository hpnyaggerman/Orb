"""The backend layer stack, enforced rather than described.

``scripts/check_backend_layers.py`` is wired into ``scripts/lint.sh``; this
runs it from the suite too, because a layering violation is the kind of thing
that gets written and committed between two lint runs. The check parses
imports — see the script's docstring for why a grep is the wrong tool here.
