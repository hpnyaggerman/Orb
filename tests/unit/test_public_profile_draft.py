"""The public-profile output contract, pinned on both draft functions.

The system prompt asks the model for a scene-safe two-liner; this is the half
that does not depend on the model agreeing. Both the card editor and Manage cast
drain the same forced call through the same checks, so exercising both public
entry points is what stops the card and scene routes drifting on a safety
boundary that only one of them is loudly tested for.

Three rejections, each for a failure a later reader cannot recover from:

* a blank field silently publishes nothing about that member;
* a brace survives into a string that is macro-resolved at *turn* time
  (``inference/group_context._render_public_cast``), so an approved profile
  would mutate months later;
* an overlong field is billed to every member of the cast on every call.
