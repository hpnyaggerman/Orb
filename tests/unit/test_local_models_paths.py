"""Where the weights and the llama-server binary actually live.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR DOES NOT RAISE. Both directories are derived by
counting ``__file__`` up to the repo root, and a module that moves one level
deeper without its count moving with it resolves to
``backend/inference/data/models/`` instead: ``model_dir()`` creates it happily,
every model then reports as missing, and the next Download button pulls 9.6 GB
into the wrong place. Nothing anywhere says so.

Pinned against the repo root computed from *this* file, which sits at a known
depth of its own.
