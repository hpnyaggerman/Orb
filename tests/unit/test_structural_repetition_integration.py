"""
test_structural_repetition_integration.py — Regression test for structural
repetition detection through the _run_contextual_audit integration path.

The bug: _run_contextual_audit passed full_text (previous msgs + draft
concatenated) as the `text` arg to run_audit, which forwarded it as the
"current message" to detect_structural_repetition.  The detector then compared
individual previous messages against a doubled-up blob, collapsing similarity
to ~0.67 and suppressing the flag.
