"""Re-encoding on the way out (display) and on the way in (references).

The reference half is the one with a contract: a destination that declares
`allowed`/`max_bytes` must be honoured or refused, while one that declares nothing
stays best effort. Both halves live here rather than beside each backend, because
the rule is the same wherever the bytes are going.
