"""Asking the provider instead of tabulating it.

This replaced two hand-measured tables -- how many references each provider reads,
and which of its models read any -- that could never be finished against catalogues
of hundreds of models, and whose "not measured yet" default silently withheld a
capability the user had configured and paid for.

The refusal messages quoted below are the real ones, measured 2026-08-19 against
live keys. Every one of them was **free**: the provider refused before rendering
and billed nothing, which is the whole reason asking is cheaper than tabulating.
