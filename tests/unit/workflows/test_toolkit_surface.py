"""Pins the workflow locks onto the toolkit's public re-export surface.

Workflow authors import everything from ``backend.workflows.toolkit``,
so the three workflow locks must be reachable there to guard a read-modify-write
on any state tier without importing ``backend.core.locks`` directly. These assertions
fail if a lock is dropped from the re-export, omitted from ``__all__``, or rebound
to something other than the canonical ``backend.core.locks`` object.
