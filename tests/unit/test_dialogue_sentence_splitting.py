"""
Tests for dialogue-aware sentence splitting in slop_detector and contrastive_negation.

Root issue: the naive (?<=[.!?])\\s+ lookbehind fails when a closing quote sits
between the sentence-ending punctuation and the following space (e.g. !" or ?").
The action tag after dialogue ("she screamed, her voice cracking.") gets fused
into the same sentence as the preceding dialogue, so banned phrases inside it
are reported with an unusably long sentence context that the editor can't locate
in the draft.
