"""Unit tests for the pure workflow-enablement predicates.

``effective_workflow_enabled`` is the ``global AND local`` truth table with
both sides defaulting to on when absent, plus a defensive coercion that turns a
stray non-dict ``workflow_enabled`` into "enabled" rather than raising.
``disabled_workflow_tool_names`` projects the registry to the tool names owned
by currently-disabled workflows; it reads ``list_workflows`` (monkeypatched here
so the test owns the registry view without touching process-global state).
