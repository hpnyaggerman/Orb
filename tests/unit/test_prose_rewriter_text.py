"""The prompt contract and the output repairs.

THE PROMPT IS PINNED BYTE-FOR-BYTE because it is a property of the weights, not
a setting. It is asserted literally rather than rebuilt from the implementation's
own f-string, which would agree with any change made to it.

The REPAIRS are pinned against the corpus defect each one exists for and — as
importantly — against the near-misses they must NOT fire on: an abbreviation is
not a sentence boundary and an emoticon is not punctuation spacing.
