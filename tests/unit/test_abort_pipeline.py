"""
Regression tests for stop-generation abort propagation through the pipeline.

Verifies that aborting during the director pass prevents the writer pass from
firing, and aborting during the writer pass prevents the editor pass from firing.

Also verifies the error-abort corner case: a genuine error in any of the three
passes aborts the pipeline (the exception propagates out of ``_run_pipeline``)
rather than being swallowed, so a failed pass ends the turn just like a manual
abort does — never producing a half-processed draft.
