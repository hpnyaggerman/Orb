"""The voice-enrollment routes: upload -> stored voice -> clear.

The models are never present in CI, so the 503 path is what runs there and the
happy path runs only where the codec is available. Both matter: "the model is
not downloaded" and "that file is not audio" are different answers.

Enrollment is stubbed in the happy-path tests rather than run for real — what
is under test here is the ROUTE's contract (what it writes, what it selects,
what it returns), and running a real 24 MB ONNX graph would test the enrollment
that ``test_spark_enroll`` already pins.
