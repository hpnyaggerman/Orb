"""Fan-out suspension: a disabled workflow's PRE/POST hooks do not fire.

Drives the bridge iterators directly with probe hooks and varying settings. The
gate reads the settings snapshot threaded into each seam, so global-off suppresses
every workflow and local-off suppresses exactly one. The last test pins the 3.9
contract: format_consistency now carries no config gate of its own, so the
framework toggle is its sole on/off.
