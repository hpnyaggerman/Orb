"""Age-based data cleanup: /api/storage and /api/storage/cleanup.

The cleanup is deliberately asymmetric and these tests pin that asymmetry:

  - Artifacts are *evicted*, not deleted. The row and its recovery metadata
    survive so the image comes back through the normal rehydrate path, which is
    only true if the cleanup reuses the same sentinel the budget eviction uses.
  - Rows without recovery metadata (TTS audio stores no seed) are skipped, not
    destroyed -- for those the bytes are the only copy.
  - Agent logs have no recovery path and are a real DELETE.

The preview route must agree with the cleanup it previews, otherwise the age
choice in the UI is made against numbers that do not match the outcome.
