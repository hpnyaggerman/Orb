"""LLM client substitute for integration tests of the streaming pipeline.

The real ``backend.inference.client.LLMClient`` reaches the OpenAI-compatible
endpoint over httpx. Concurrency tests do not need that round-trip; they
need a deterministic, in-process stand-in whose timing the test
controls. ``FakeLLMClient`` provides that: its ``complete()`` is an
async generator that yields canned reasoning / done events, optionally
waiting on a per-pass ``asyncio.Event`` so a test can hold a stream
mid-pipeline while another concurrent action arrives.

Pass dispatch is by ``tool_choice`` rather than a call counter, because
director may be skipped entirely (gated behind ``has_pre_writer_tools``
in the orchestrator) and editor iterates multiple times per turn -- a
positional scheme would mis-bind queued responses.
