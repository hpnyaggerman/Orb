Integration test fixtures.

Strategy:
- Patch backend.database.connection.DB_PATH to a per-test temp file before any DB call.
- Call init_db() directly (bypasses FastAPI lifespan, which ASGITransport does not trigger).
- Yield an httpx.AsyncClient wired to the real ASGI app.
- Yield a raw aiosqlite connection for direct DB assertions.

    ``backend.core.locks._workflow_state_locks`` and
    ``_workflow_character_state_locks`` (both ``(key, workflow_id)`` tuples)
    which the orchestrator and ``/trigger`` route acquire. Each test gets a
    fresh temp DB, so autoincrement ids restart at 1 and those keys collide
    across tests. A ``Lock`` binds to the event loop of its first ``acquire``;
    reusing one cached under a prior test's (now closed) loop raises "got
    Future attached to a different loop" the moment a waiter Future is created
    on the stale loop. That only bites when two tests contend on a shared key,
    which today's UUID/one-off keys happen to avoid -- clearing all four dicts
    removes the latent flake instead of relying on that coincidence.

    The default ``client`` fixture wraps the app in ``ASGITransport``,
    which accumulates the entire response body before producing the
    ``Response`` object. Any test that pauses the server inside the
    response generator (e.g. by gating an LLM call) deadlocks under that
    transport because the client cannot enter the response body until the
    server has fully finished sending it. A real HTTP loopback restores
    incremental delivery so the test can observe a streamed event,
    interact with the server while the stream is still open, and then
    drive the stream to completion.

    Lifespan is disabled to match the existing ``client`` fixture, which
