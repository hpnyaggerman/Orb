Integration test fixtures.

Strategy:
- Patch backend.database.connection.DB_PATH to a per-test temp file before any DB call.
- Seed that file by copying a session-scoped template built once by init_db()
  (bypasses FastAPI lifespan, which ASGITransport does not trigger).
- Yield an httpx.AsyncClient wired to the real ASGI app.
- Yield a raw aiosqlite connection for direct DB assertions.

    fresh temp DB, so autoincrement ids restart at 1 and those keys collide
    across tests. A ``Lock`` binds to the event loop of its first ``acquire``;
    reusing one cached under a prior test's (now closed) loop raises "got
    Future attached to a different loop" the moment a waiter Future is created
    on the stale loop. That only bites when two tests contend on a shared key,

    removes the latent flake instead of relying on that coincidence.
