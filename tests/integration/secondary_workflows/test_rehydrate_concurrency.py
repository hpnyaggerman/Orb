"""Pins per-root serialization of ``/rehydrate``.

Two concurrent rehydrate requests against the same evicted root must
invoke the workflow's ``reroll_gen`` hook exactly once: the first acquires
``_workflow_root_lock(root_id)`` and runs the regen; the second waits,
acquires after the first releases, re-reads the row inside the lock,
observes that ``data_b64`` is no longer the eviction sentinel, and 409s
without spending a second LLM call. The bytes-write race is also closed
by the cache helper's ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` recheck downstream; the in-lock
re-read in the handler is what prevents double work on the upstream side.
